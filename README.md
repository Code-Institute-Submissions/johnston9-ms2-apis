  - #### Typography
    - Roboto was chosen as the main body font for its clarity and friendly sophistication. It gives a serious but open feel to the site. Goldman was blended in with this for the main titles to give style and an exciting and ever so slightly futuristic feel.

- #### Imagery
  - The landing page has a deep rich serious and sophisticated cryptocurrency image overlaying an image if the New York skyline to give immediate understanding of what the site is all about. The use of strong rich cryptocurrency images throughout the site give it an exciting dynamic feel. The interactive coin all features have a blue and silver background to give them a usable inviting feel. This lies at the heart of the site giving people this approach to cryptocurrency and not overwhelming them with data and graphs.
